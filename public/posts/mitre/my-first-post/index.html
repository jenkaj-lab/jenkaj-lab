  <p>Hello, my name is Alex Jenkins and I am a Cyber Security professional and enthusiast. At the time of writing I have been working as a SOC analyst in an MSSP for about 7 months. Prior to this I was self employed as a Carpenter. This post marks the start of my blog.</p>
<p>This blog will contain articles from my personal hands-on experience with the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, documenting my journey and experience. In this journey I will be exploring MITRE&rsquo;s tactics, techniques and sub-techniques from the perspectives of both the red and blue team. The goal is for each sub-technique explored to be documented fully from start-to-finish with configuration, red team engagement, and blue team analysis.</p>
<p>Though this is a personal project that is shared with the goal of improving as a security analyst, I welcome the input of all my readers and invite you to share any thoughts and experiences you have. You can leave a comment on each post, or email me directly at <a href="mailto:jenkins.alexanderj@gmail.com">jenkins.alexanderj@gmail.com</a>. Follow along with my journey, and let me know what techniques you&rsquo;d like to see explored as we dive deeper into ATT&amp;CKs.</p>
