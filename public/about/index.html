  <p>My name is Alex. I&rsquo;m a cyber security professional and enthusiast. I write technical blog posts covering techniques from the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, complete with configuration, red team engagement, blue team investigation and response.</p>
<p>My background is in carpentry, but I always loved computers. One day I decided to give up on construction and throw myself back into college to learn more about programming. In college I had a taster of cyber security through open days and optional courses - enough to get excited about it, but nothing substantial. Two years of college led to four years of university studying a course in cyber security and forensic computing. I graduated with a first class honours and a month later I landed a job as a SOC analyst. That was back in July 2024.</p>
<p>This blog began as a way of keeping an online portfolio, which is still true to a degree, but it&rsquo;s more than that now. I didn&rsquo;t realise this at the time, but it turns out you can learn a hell of a lot if you start setting up, breaking and fixing your own stuff. What I&rsquo;m learning here by tinkering is bleeding into my day job, and it&rsquo;s making me a more well-rounded analyst. When I started as a T1 analyst I knew how to triage, but this taught me log ingestion on a deeper level, how to write detection rules, live configuration of systems and software (i.e. SIEMs, IDS systems, Active Directory), network administration, and so much more.</p>
<p>We learn how to fully configure systems here. I do my best to write my own red-team engagements, and pick my brain to try and plug any vulnerabilities exploited in those exercises. After that I make detection rules to make sure that we get alerted if it happens again. I don&rsquo;t have any prior experience doing anything like this so my labs are by no means perfect, but I&rsquo;m having fun figuring it out.</p>
<p>I hope that you as a reader appreciate this content, and that it brings value to you. I welcome feedback, just reach out to me on any of my socials. And although I don&rsquo;t do this for money, a little support to show your appreciation for my hard work is always welcome.</p>
