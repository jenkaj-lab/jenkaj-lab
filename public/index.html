  <p>Hello, my name is Alex and I am a Cyber Security professional and enthusiast. This blog contains articles from my personal hands-on experience with the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, documenting my journey and experience. My journey explores MITRE&rsquo;s tactics, techniques and sub-techniques from the perspectives of both the red and blue team. The goal is for each sub-technique explored to consist of full configuration, red team engagement, and blue team investigation.</p>
<p>Though this is a personal project that is shared with the goal of improving as a security analyst, I welcome the input of all my readers and invite you to share any thoughts and experiences you have. Follow along with my journey, and let me know what techniques you&rsquo;d like to see explored as we dive deeper into ATT&amp;CKs.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a common Application Layer protocol that communicates over port 53. Many organisations will allow traffic over this protocol because it is essential for translating domain names into IP addresses. Adversaries may use this to their advantage and communicate with their Command and Control (C2) servers over this commonly-used protocol, blending in with normal traffic.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lab I will be demonstrating the MITRE ATT&amp;CK sub-technique <code>T1110.001: Password Guessing</code>. This involves exploiting Active Directory&rsquo;s (AD) Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), harnessing its authentication mechanism to brute force a known user&rsquo;s password. Wazuh is used to analyze the logs generated resulting from both the authentication failures and success post account compromise.</p>
