Hello, my name is Alex and I am a Cyber Security professional and enthusiast. This blog contains articles from my personal hands-on experience with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, documenting my journey and experience. My journey explores MITRE's tactics, techniques and sub-techniques from the perspectives of both the red and blue team. The goal is for each sub-technique explored to consist of full configuration, red team engagement, and blue team investigation.

Though this is a personal project that is shared with the goal of improving as a security analyst, I welcome the input of all my readers and invite you to share any thoughts and experiences you have. Follow along with my journey, and let me know what techniques you'd like to see explored as we dive deeper into ATT&CKs.
