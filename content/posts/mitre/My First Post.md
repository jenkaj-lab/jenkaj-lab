Hello, my name is Alex Jenkins and I am a Cyber Security professional and enthusiast. At the time of writing I have been working as a SOC analyst in an MSSP for about 7 months. Prior to this I was self employed as a Carpenter. This post marks the start of my blog. 

This blog will contain articles from my personal hands-on experience with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, documenting my journey and experience. In this journey I will be exploring MITRE's tactics, techniques and sub-techniques from the perspectives of both the red and blue team. The goal is for each sub-technique explored to be documented fully from start-to-finish with configuration, red team engagement, and blue team analysis. I intend to abide by the following rules to ensure a well-documented approach, and so that the actions I take are easy to follow and repeatable for the reader.

1. Full configurations for each setup dependent on the type of tactics and techniques in use. This includes any users created, software installed, etc.
2. MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques will be clearly listed with relevant IDs
3. Red team engagements will include a list of tools, techniques and sample code used (where custom scripts are used).
4. Blue team investigations must follow a logical flow, ensuring that it is treated as a "real" incident. This means that adequate detection and mitigation techniques are implemented upon discovery of vulnerabilities.
5. If a configuration step is not explicitly mentioned it has been left as default.

These rules will be updated over time, and will likely have their own page when the blog is more established. But for now, for my sake and for any readers, these are my expectations. I'm hoping this blog will be a good addition to my portfolio, and that I learn a lot throughout this journey.

Though this is a personal project that is shared with the goal of improving as a security analyst, I welcome the input of all my readers and invite you to share any thoughts and experiences you have. You can leave a comment on each post, or email me directly at jenkins.alexanderj@gmail.com. Follow along with my journey, and let me know what techniques you'd like to see explored as we dive deeper into ATT&CKs.
