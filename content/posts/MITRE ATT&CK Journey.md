Hello. My name is Alex Jenkins. I am currently working as a SOC analyst for an MSSP and have been for about 7 months. This post marks the start of my blog. 

This blog will contain articles from my personal hands-on experience with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, documenting my journey and experience. In this journey I will be exploring all of MITRE's tactics, techniques and sub-techniques from the perspectives of both the red and blue team.

With this blog I intend to abide by the following rules to ensure a well-documented approach, and to ensure the actions I take are easy to follow and repeatable for the reader.

1. Full configurations for each setup will be provided. This will obviously depend on the type of tactics and techniques in use.
2. MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques will be clearly listed with relevant IDs
3. Red team engagements will include a list of tools, techniques and sample code used (for custom attacks). As well as OS version numbers and necessary configurations for the pentest machine. An example pentest report should be included at the end of the engagement for each successful vulnerability exploited.
4. Blue team investigations must follow a logical flow, ensuring that it is treated as a "real" incident response - this means that necessary detection and mitigation techniques are implemented upon discovery of vulnerabilities. Similar to red-team engagements, an incident response document must be provided at the end of the blue-team investigation.

These rules will be updated over time, and will likely have their own page when the blog is more established. But for now, for my sake and for any readers, these are my expectations.

I'm hoping this blog will be a good addition to my portfolio, and that I learn a lot throughout this journey.

Though this is a personal project that is shared with the goal of improving as a security analyst, I welcome the input of all my readers and invite you to share any thoughts and experiences you have. You can leave a comment on each post, or email me directly on {email}

Subscribe to follow along with my journey, and let me know what techniques you'd like to see explored as we dive deeper into ATT&CKs.
